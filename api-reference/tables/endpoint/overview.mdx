These table management endpoints help you programmatically upload data to Dune and manage tables via the API.

To upload data, while you can use the [`/upload endpoint`](./upload), consider using the [`/create`](./create) and [`/insert`](./insert) endpoints for more flexibility, performance, and the ability to append.
